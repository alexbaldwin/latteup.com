        <p class="first">So you want to write some copy? Pull up a seat, you’ve come to the right place. But don’t be nervous: this is just a guide to help you write interesting and informative content that suits Dripstr. It’s more important to be clear, concise, and relevant than get caught up in the technicalities of an oh-so-boring style guide.</p>

        <h3 class="h2 sans-serif caps">Voice &amp; Tone</h3>

        <p>Dripstr’s voice is human, and it should sound like a trusted friend who’s giving you the goods. It’s an honest voice with an approachable tone, and it literally speaks to the reader using words like “you” (“you just have to go” “the first thing you’ll notice”). While the voice is human, it’s also third person, so avoid references like “we” (“we love the cappuccino” or “our favourite beans”) and instead focus on the coffee shop (“They make a mean cappuccino” or “The most popular beans”).</p>

        <p class="p">Coffee is casual, inviting, and loved by pretty much everyone, so your copy should reflect that. It’s not informal, but it is smart and educated. Don’t be afraid to add a little spunk to your writing: you want to keep the reader engaged past the first paragraph, and using language that they actually use is an excellent way to do this.</p>

        <h3 class="h2 sans-serif caps">Grammar &amp; Spelling</h3>

        <p class="p">Use what your 3rd grade teacher gave you! Also known as common grammatical sense. The one thing you will notice across Dripstr though, is that we use the highly controversial practice of the <a href="http://imgur.com/fycHx">Oxford Comma</a>. As far as spelling goes, we use American English, which means no extra “u’s” in color, favorite, and so forth.</p>


        <h3 class="h2 sans-serif caps">Writing Tips</h3>

        <p class="p">The best way to write in the Dripstr tone is to read all of the copy, read it again, pretend you’re going somewhere and want to know about coffee, and then just write. After you have your basics, re-read your copy and look for opportunities to make it more fun and casual. But be careful: too much wit and not enough substance never gets anyone going. The posts should be easy to digest and quick to scan, generally using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid">inverted pyramid</a> with a catchy and interesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_paragraph">lede</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="h2 sans-serif caps">Interviewing &amp; Research</h3>

        <p class="p">The easiest way to learn about a coffee shop is through both an interview and research. Make sure you include information like which beans they brew (micro-roastery vs multi-roastery, how do they serve drip coffee?), what kind of food is served,  what the aesthetic is like, and how the vibe feels (can you camp out there on the wifi all day?). Draft up sample questions beforehand, such as “what is the first thing you notice when you walk in?” or “who would you bring here with you: a date, your mom, your awkward nerdy cousin?”</p>
